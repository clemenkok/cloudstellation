The objective of this project is to build a resume website using several AWS services. It is based off of the [challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) created by Forrest Brazeal.  

The challenge can be broken down into multiple stages.  

> Stage 1: Cloud Website
> Skills: HTML/CSS, Git, cloud storage, CDN, DNS
> 
> Stage 2: Serverless API
> Skills: Cloud compute, NoSQL database, Python
> 
> Stage 3: Front End / Back End Integration
> Skills: Javascript, cloud monitoring, end-to-end testing
> 
> Stage 4: Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD
> Skills: Terraform, GitHub Actions, cloud secrets management  

Using this challenge as a guide, I created my own [website](clemenkok.com) where I wrote about my portfolio and past experiences.
